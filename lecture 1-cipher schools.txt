difference between procedural oriented programminga and object oriented programming
pop:
1.drived from  structural programming
2.program divided into small parts called functions.
3.function is more improtant than data.
4.follow top down approach.
5.based on unreal world.
6.no proper way of hiding data (less secure).
7.examples:c,fortran,pascal,basic etc;;

oops:
1.based on real world.
2.program divided into small parts called objects.
3.oops follows bottom up approach.
4.data hiding is possible (more secure).
5.ading new data and function is much eaiser.
examples:c++,java,python,c# etc..

Objects and Classes in Java

objects:any thing has state and behaviour is know as "object in java".
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

class:
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
A class in Java can contain:
    ->Fields
    ->Methods
    ->Constructors
    ->Blocks
    ->Nested class and interface
